-- LeetCode 262: Trips and Users
-- URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/trips-and-users/
-- Approach:
-- 1) Filter trips to the 3-day window and ensure both client and driver are unbanned by joining Users twice.
-- 2) Group the filtered rows by request_at (the day).
-- 3) Compute the cancellation fraction per day using SUM and ROUND to 2 decimals.
--    Multiplying by 1.0 avoids integer-division issues and keeps the expression concise.
-- 4) Return request_at AS Day and the rounded Cancellation Rate. Order by Day for readability.

SELECT
  day,
  ROUND(SUM(is_cancelled) * 1.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS `Cancellation Rate`
FROM (
  SELECT
    t.request_at AS day,
    (t.status IN ('cancelled_by_client','cancelled_by_driver')) + 0 AS is_cancelled
  FROM Trips t
  JOIN Users uc ON uc.users_id = t.client_id
  JOIN Users ud ON ud.users_id = t.driver_id
  WHERE uc.banned = 'No'
    AND ud.banned = 'No'
    AND t.request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'
) sub
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day;

-- Alternative (CTE + explicit counts) â€” equivalent logic:
-- WITH UnbannedTrips AS (
--   SELECT t.request_at, t.status
--   FROM Trips t
--   JOIN Users uc ON uc.users_id = t.client_id AND uc.banned = 'No'
--   JOIN Users ud ON ud.users_id = t.driver_id AND ud.banned = 'No'
--   WHERE t.request_at BETWEEN '2013-10-01' AND '2013-10-03'
-- )
-- SELECT
--   request_at AS Day,
--   ROUND(
--     SUM(CASE WHEN status IN ('cancelled_by_client','cancelled_by_driver') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0
--     / COUNT(*)
--   , 2) AS `Cancellation Rate`
-- FROM UnbannedTrips
-- GROUP BY request_at
-- ORDER BY Day;
